          <p>Simply put, because it's fun!</p>
          <p>I love weddings. It's an honor to be a part of such a beautiful day. I enjoy crafting a fun, danceable atmosphere and energy for the reception.</p>
          <p>Because it's not a full-time job, I bring an energy and enthusiasm that most DJ's can't.</p>
          <p>At my first gig, I even hooked up the venue's overhead string lights to my lighting rig. Every light in the place was synchronized.</p>
