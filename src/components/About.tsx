            <h2>About the DJ</h2>
            <p>I'm a software engineer for a local game company. I have a passion for music and visuals.</p>
            <p>I've been playing, writing, and mixing music my entire life.</p>
            <p>More recently, I became fascinated with stage lighting, to the point of creating my own stage lighting software.</p>
            <p>Through the years, I developed an intimate understanding of the gear involved in a DJ setup.</p>
